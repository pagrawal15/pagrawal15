 👩‍💻 Priyanka Agrawal – Data Scientist & Analytics Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

I like solving complex problems and turning messy data into meaningful insights. Over the years, I’ve discovered that building statistical models isn’t just about numbers — it’s about answering real questions: Why is churn increasing? Can we predict disease risks earlier? How do we detect fraud before it happens?

That curiosity has led me to work across data engineering and data science — from designing streaming pipelines that handle millions of records in real time, to building predictive models that support decision-making in healthcare, banking, and advertising technology.

This GitHub is where I share a few projects that mimic the kind of work I do in industry — from building streaming pipelines to developing predictive models — reflecting my passion for solving data problems end to end.
